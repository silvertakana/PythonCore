Mathematics includes the study of such topics as quantity, structure, space, and change. 
It has no generally accepted definition. 
Mathematicians seek and use patterns to formulate new conjectures; 
they resolve the truth or falsity of such by mathematical proof.

Computer programming is the process of designing and building an executable computer program to accomplish a specific computing result or to perform a specific task.

Life is a characteristic that distinguishes physical entities that have biological processes, 
such as signaling and self-sustaining processes, 
from those that do not, either because such functions have ceased, 
or because they never had such functions and are classified as inanimate.Artificial intelligence is intelligence demonstrated by machines, as opposed to the natural intelligence displayed by humans or animals.

Artificial neural networks, usually simply called neural networks, are computing systems inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains. An ANN is based on a collection of connected units or nodes called artificial neurons, which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain.
